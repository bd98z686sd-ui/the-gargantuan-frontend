/*
 * Tailwind CSS base, component and utility styles.
 *
 * We use the @tailwind directives instead of importing the JavaScript
 * entrypoint directly. Importing 'tailwindcss' itself causes PostCSS
 * to attempt to parse a JavaScript file (tailwindcss/lib/index.js) as
 * CSS, leading to errors such as "Unknown word \"use strict\"". The
 * @tailwind directives tell PostCSS to generate the appropriate
 * layers from the configured tailwind.config.cjs.
